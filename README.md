# 8Track Node

8Track Node is a test-driven Node API with a PostgreSQL database. It uses Express to power a server, as well as for HTTP utility methods. The API exposes data related to musical artists and songs.

The database was setup using PostgreSQL and Knex. Knex is used to build the schema, as well as to build SQL queries to the database.

The second iteration of this project will feature a React front-end which will render the data to the DOM.

Server tests make HTTP assertions performed by the Super-agent driven library, SuperTest, along with Mocha and Chai.
