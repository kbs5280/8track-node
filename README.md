# 8 Track Node  

[WIP] 8 Track Node is a Node.js server and API with a PostgreSQL database. The API servers data related to playlists. Each playlist has a set of songs featuring a title and artist.

The database was setup using Knex.js. The Node.js API uses Knex.js to query the database.

The second iteration of this project will feature a React front end which will render the data.

Server tests utilize HTTP assertions made by, Super-agent driven library, SuperTest.
